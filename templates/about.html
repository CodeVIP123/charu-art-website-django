        <h2>Background</h2>
        <b>Charuâ€™s Canvas Art Classes began in 2015 with just a handful of students. Today, it has grown into a global community, reaching 10+ countries and benefiting 1,000+ students through both online and offline learning modes.
            <br>
            <br>
            Here, we donâ€™t just teach artâ€”we help you discover your creativity, build confidence, and create a joyful, fulfilling space beyond the noise of the digital era.
            <br>
            <br>
            Founder Charu Keserwani, originally from a technology background with an MCA, found her true passion in the world of art. To sharpen her skills, she completed her BFA, which helped her develop a unique and effective teaching style. Charu makes learning art approachable, breaking down even complex concepts into easy steps.
            <br>
            <br>
            With immense patience and personal attention, Charu ensures that every student progresses at their own pace, whether they are beginners or advanced learners.
            <br>
            <br>
            A strong focus of Charuâ€™s journey has been to empower homemakers who lost touch with their passions in the busyness of life. Many of Charuâ€™s students have now started their own art classes, carrying forward the creative spark.</b>
